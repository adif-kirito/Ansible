# Ansible

## What is Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for IT tasks like configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It simplifies the management of complex systems by automating routine tasks without needing custom scripts or complex programming.

## Installation Step

Install Ansible

```
sudo apt install ansible
```

Install sshpass

```
sudo apt install sshpass
```

## Setting Up

### Add Host to Group

1. Go to ansible directory - `cd /etc/ansible`
2. Edit `hosts` file. Must use **SUDO**
3. At the bottom, add server hostname and ip address. Add also the username and password to connect to the slave server.

### Add user to slave server

* Add user using the same credential as the step above to the slave server

### Configure ansible config file

1. Go to ansible directory - `cd /etc/ansible`
2. Edit `ansible.cfg` file. Must use **SUDO**
3. Uncomment the part shown below

## Vault

Vault is a feature used to securely store and manage sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential information. It allows you to encrypt variables, files, or entire playbooks to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected even when stored in version control systems like Git.

### Key Features of Ansible Vault

* **Encryption and Decryption:** Ansible Vault can encrypt data to make it readable only when decrypted using the correct password or key
* **Integration with Playbooks:** Encrypted data can be used within playbooks, ensuring that sesitive variables are secure but still usable during task execution
* **Flexibility:** You can encrypt individual variables, specific files (such as vars or inventory files), or entire playbooks

### Common Uses Cases

* Storing **credentials** (e.g. database passwords, SSH keys)
* Securing **API tokens** or **access keys**
* Encrypting **configuration files** that include sensitive information

### Basic Commands for Using Ansible Vault

* Create an Encrypted File
  ```
  ansible-vault create secrets.yml
  ```
  This command opens an editor where you can add your sensitive information. Once saved, `secrets.yml` will be encrypted.

* Encrypt an Existing File
  ```
  ansible-vault encrypt existing_file.yml
  ```
  Encrypts `existing_file.yml` in place, converting its content to an encrypted format.

* Decrypt an Encrypted File
  ```
  ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
  ```
  Opens the encrypted file in an editor for modifications while maintaining its encrypted state after saving.

* View an Encrypted File
  ```
  ansible-vault view secrets.yml
  ```
  Displays the decrypted content in a read-only format without altering the encrypted file.

* Encrypt Variables in Playbooks
  ```
  vars_files:
    -	secrets.yml
  ```
  Encrypted variables can be included in playbooks like this

### Using Vault Passwords
To run playbooks that use encrypted variables, you need to provide the decryption password

* Interactive Mode
  ```
  ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
  ```
  Prompts for the vault password interactively.

* Interactive Mode
  ```
  ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file /path/to/password-file
  ```
  You can use a password file for non-interactive execution.

  ## Playbooks

  An Ansible Playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be executed on target hosts. Itâ€™s essentially a blueprint for automating complex IT workflows, such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. Playbooks are more powerful and flexible than simple ad hoc Ansible commands because they allow you to specify detailed instructions, variables, and control structures.

  ### Key Concepts of Playbooks

  * **Plays:** A playbook can consist of one or more plays, which are sections that map a group of hosts to a set of tasks.
  * **Tasks:** Each play consists of tasks that represent individual steps. Tasks call Ansible modules to perform actions like installing packages, copying files, and restarting services.
  * **Modules:** Tasks use Ansible modules (e.g., yum, apt, service) to accomplish specific actions.
  * **Hosts:** Specifies which hosts or groups of hosts (from the inventory) the play should run on.
  * **Variables:** You can define variables for use within tasks to make playbooks more flexible and reusable.
 
  ### Basic Structure of a playbook

  ### Explanation of the Playbook

  * **name:** Provides a descriptive name for the play or task.
  * **hosts:** Specifies the target group of hosts where the play runs, defined in the inventory.
  * **become: yes:** Indicates that tasks should run with elevated privileges (e.g., using sudo).
  * **vars:** Defines variables that can be used in tasks.
  * **tasks:** A list of actions to execute, each specifying a module and its parameters.
 
  ### Benefits of Using Playbooks

  * **Readable Sysntax:** YAML-based syntax that is easy for humans to read and write.
  * **Reusability:** Playbooks can be modular and reusable, especially with the use of roles.
  * **Idempotency:** Ensures that running a playbook multiple times results in the same state, preventing unintended changes.
  * **Scalability:** Playbooks can manage thousands of hosts with consistent configurations.
 
  Playbooks are powerful tools for managing infrastructure as code and automating complex workflows across various environments.

## Additional Information

```
ansible -m command -a "uptime" -i hosts redhat --ask-vault-pass -e @vault.yml
```

* `-i hosts redhat` - If using different hosts file, use `-i` tag to define the hosts file location
* `-e @vault.yml` - If the slave server credential is store in a vault file, use `-e` to define extra variable and `@` to let ansible read the content of the vault file. Then define the vault file location
